        "\n",
        "In this homework, you will write code that generates features for the positive/negative sentiment classification of movie\n",
        "reviews, and train a model on those features to predict the sentiment of new data. Example of selected movie reviews\n",
        "with labels:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Label | Review\n",
        "| :--- | :------\n",
        "| **pos** | What can I say, it’s a damn good movie. See it if you still haven’t. Great camera works and lighting <br> techniques. Awesome, just awesome.  Orson Welles is incredible ‘The Lady From Shanghai’ can certainly <br> take the place of ‘Citizen Kane’.\n",
        "| **neg** | Can I give this a minus rating? No? Well, let me say that this is the most atrocious film I have ever tried to <br> watch. It was Painful. Boringus Maximus. The plot(?) is well hidden in several sub-levels of <br> nebulosity. I rented this film with a friend and, after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better, we <br> decided to “fast forward” a little to see if things would get any better. It never gets better. This film about <br> some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls, sounds interesting, but, in reality, it is just a bore. <br> Nothing even remotely interesting ever happens. If you ever get the chance to watch this, do <br> yourself a favor, try “PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE” instead ”  \n",

        "the accuracy of the model on the test data.\n",

        "Your main tasks regarding *classification* are to **implement four features**:\n",
        "1. A bag of words feature. Fill out the **bag_of_words** function in the notebook to represent a document through its bag of words. Represent each **lowercase** word tokenized with the NLTK **word_tokenize** function through its binary value. Remember that the feature value for a word that shows up in a review should be 1, no matter how many times it is mentioned. Please keep your code between the **#BEGIN/#END SOLUTION** flags.\n",
        "2. Create **three** different classes of features. Implement them in the **feature1** **feature2** and **feature3** functions. Create features that you think would perform better than bag of words, and assess their independent performance on the development data. Describe your reasoning in your Colab notebook and include accuracy scores on the dev.txt data (printed in the Colab output). **You must report your reasoning and development scores in the table provided.** It is not required that your features actually perform well, but your justification and reasoning should be defensible. We are looking for thoughtful insights as to why your original features *should* outperform the simple bag of words implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more feature ideas consult [SLP Ch. 5](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/5.pdf) and lecture slides, and please do keep the following constraints in mind:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Do not use pre-trained word vectors (including static embeddings like word2vec or contextual embeddings like BERT); we will cover these later.\n",
        "* Do not use the predictions of any other supervised model on this data as a feature for logistic regression (e.g., do not train a separate CNN on this data, make predictions on the dev data using the CNN, and then treat your CNN prediction as a feature).\n",
        "* Do not alter {train,dev,test}.txt or find additional sources of training data. This homework is focusing on how you *represent* your data, not other aspects of the training regime.\n",
        "* Do not import any other additional libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "After completing classificaion there is a **task** for *evaluation*:\n",
        "1. Fill in the dictionary `param_grid`, to find which L2 regularization strength improves your model the most.\n",
        "\n",
        "The assignment ends with a **reflection**:\n",

It is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are passionately fond of each other, even though, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. I did feel though that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young Queen, is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. As it is rumoured that he was in fact, the real father of Victoria (as a result of an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young Princess, trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England, which prospered as never before, under her long reign. I believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie.\\n\")"

Hyperparameter tuning enables us to adjust the hyperparameters of our model, specifically those not learned from the data, to optimize its performance.

Then, complete `param_grid` for `C` (values closer to 0 = stronger regularization)** to find which L2 regularization strength improves your model the most.
